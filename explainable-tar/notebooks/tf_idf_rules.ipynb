    "Rule Extraction from Fuzzy ARTMAP Model with Reuters-21578 Corpus on the \"Earn\" Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates using the saved (pickled) tf-idf vectorizer and the saved Fuzzy ARTMAP Model (A and AB weights, and the set of committed nodes) to generate fuzzy If-Then rules of document relevance.\n",
    "The indexes of the first part of the weight_a vectors correspond to the labels of the tf-idf, this is also repeated in the second part of the weight_a vectors, but the weights are complement encoded to denote absence instead of presence.  The set of committed nodes is used to limit the number of rules and categories explored, because the Fuzzy ARTMAP algorithm supports adding categories at run-time, requiring only fixed input architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model in the ./example_data was generated from running Fuzzy ARTMAP with the following parameters (shown in the JSON block below) indicating running against the Reuters-21578 corpus with the \"earn\" topic as the relevant category, baseline vigilance is 0.95 (rho_a_bar) using fast learning (committed_beta) and random active learning.\n",
